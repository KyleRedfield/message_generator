# Positive Words of Encouragment

## How does it work?

1. The program will first generate a random number using .length on an array.
2. There is an object with 2 keys that contain arrays. These array contain the different phrases or words that the number generator will select.
3. A for loop will itterate through the object to select the keys which grabs the .length for the number generator.
4. The switch statement generates a message for the 3 keys.
5. Finally a function is ran to log the messages to the console.

## Why I did this project:

1. To practice my JS syntax.
2. To practice using the command line along with GitHub and VS Code.
